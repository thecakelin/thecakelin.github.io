      <h2 class="oxygen">Hey y’all, I'm Cakelin!</h2>
      <p class="oxygen">I’m a computational biochemist by training, a full stack developer by profession and an artist/writer by choice. My career expertise is in data analytics, machine learning, and visualization with a focus on research, policy and healthcare. Underneath all of that has been struggles with upward class mobility, health issues, and cycles of trauma related to complex PTSD (you can read more about my path through tech <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/tech-disability-project/the-gift-of-grey-spaces-in-our-careers-bc01b925eb34">here</a>).</p>

      <p class="oxygen quote">If there was one thing I could do with my life, it would be to make other people feel like they are worth it and can accomplish what they want to. No matter what they've experienced or been labeled. </p>

      <p class="oxygen"><a class="link" href="https://www.oclc.org/en/home.html">What is known must be shared</a> and every opportunity to teach STEM has shown me how much potential we are currently missing out on. Humanity is going to need every person and every discipline in order to solve the challenges ahead.</p>

      <p class="oxygen">What would be possible if we could predict which decisions to make to align with our goals? If we had tools to live our values? What if a person's unique background could be used to learn complex subjects while strengthening their existing knowledge? </p>

      <p class="oxygen">These questions are the foundation for PrediCake. PrediCake is software that empowers people to use their own data to learn and make decisions that align with their goals. This allows PrediCake to help equalize social capital and life skills for marginalized people, while capitalizing on their strengths. As a believer in transparency, change starting with yourself, and being expert enough, I'll be starting with my own data.</p>

      <p class="oxygen">I'd love to hear from you! Please feel free to reach out via whichever doobly doo you like below.</p>
